# Recursion

Recursion Vs Iteration:
-------------------------------

We can write every loop in a recursive mode..
Ex : for(initialization; condition; increment)
{
      Logic goes here
}
In the similar way for every recursive function it needs to have 3 parts
1. Initialization
2. Condition
3. Increment
So lets take a recursive function..

returntype functionName(Initialization)
{
       Terminate Condition
       Logic goes here
       changing the variables like Increment and Decrement and passing        those changed variables to the same function
}
================================================================
Consider two students named "Recursion" and "Iteration".

Recursion  is optimistic and lazy.  He likes to solve the problems that are eithervery small or the problems that are almost done.

Iteration is well planned and hard working . He likes big problems.

Now you give both of them a big problem to solve,

Recursion solved it as follows:
Recursion  is too lazy to solve the big problem at once , but he knows he can  solve the problem if someone has almost done the problem. He assumed  someone has almost done it, and he completed the problem. Now he  considered the "someone's problem" and tried to solve it similarly. This  process continued until he got a small problem , which he can solve by  himself.

Iteration solved it as follows:
Iteration solved a part of the problem and kept on solving many such parts until the problem is completely solved.
